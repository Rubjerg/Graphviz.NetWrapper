 * @brief abstract graph C library, @ref cgraph_api
 * @ingroup cgraph_api
 *
 * **Libcgraph** supports graph programming by maintaining graphs
 * in memory and reading and writing graph files.
 * Graphs are composed of nodes, edges, and nested subgraphs.
 * These graph objects may be attributed with string name-value pairs
 * and programmer-defined records (see Attributes).
 * All of Libcgraphâ€™s global symbols have the prefix **ag** (case varying).
 * In the following, if a function has a parameter `int createflag` and
 * the object does not exist, the function will create the specified object
 * if `createflag` is non-zero; otherwise, it will return NULL.

/** @addtogroup cgraph_attr
 *  @{
 *
 *  @defgroup cgraph_rec records
 *  @brief These records are attached by client programs dynamically at runtime.
 *  @{
 *
 *  Uninterpreted records may be attached to graphs, subgraphs, nodes,
 *  and edges for efficient operations on values such as marks, weights,
 *  counts, and pointers needed by algorithms.
 *  Application programmers define the fields of these records,
 *  but they must be declared with a common record header @ref Agrec_t.
 *
 *  A unique string ID (stored in @ref Agrec_s.name) must be given
 *  to each record attached to the same object.
 *  Cgraph has functions to create, search for, and delete these records.
 *  The records are maintained in a circular list,
 *  with @ref Agobj_s.data pointing somewhere in the list.
 *  The search function @ref aggetrec has an option to lock this pointer on a
 * given record. The application must be written so only one such lock is
 * outstanding at a time.
 *
 *  Records are created and managed by Libcgraph.
 *  A programmer must explicitly attach them to the objects in a graph,
 *  either to individual objects one at a time via @ref agbindrec,
 *  or to all the objects of the same class in a graph via @ref aginit.
 *  The `name` argument of a record distinguishes various types of records,
 *  and is programmer defined.
 *
 *  Libcgraph reserves the prefix "_AG_" (in
 *  @ref DataDictName,
 *  @ref AgDataRecName,
 *  @ref DRName).
 *
 *  Internally, records Agrec_s are maintained in circular linked lists
 *  attached to graph objects Agobj_s.
 *  To allow referencing application-dependent data without function calls or
 * search, Libcgraph allows setting and locking the list pointer of a graph,
 * node, or edge on a particular record (see @ref Agtag_s.mtflock and @ref
 * Agobj_s.data). This pointer can be obtained with the macro @ref AGDATA(obj).
 *  A cast, generally within a macro or inline function,
 *  is usually applied to convert the list pointer to
 *  an appropriate programmer-defined type (eg. @ref GD_parent).
 *
 *  To control the setting of this pointer,
 *  the `move_to_front` flag may be TRUE or FALSE.
 *  If `move_to_front` is TRUE, the record will be
 *  locked @ref Agtag_s.mtflock at the
 *  head of the list @ref Agobj_s.data,
 *  so it can be accessed directly by @ref AGDATA(obj).
 *
 *  The lock protects the data pointer from being moved.
 *  Function @ref aggetrec reports error when data pointer and lock
 *  are reassigned.
 *
 *  The lock can be released or reset by a call to @ref agdelrec.

/** @defgroup cgraph_err error handling
 *
 * The library provides a variety of mechanisms to control
 * the reporting of errors and warnings.
 * A message is only written if its type has higher priority than
 * a programmer-controlled minimum, which is @ref AGWARN by default.
 * The programmer can set this value using @ref agseterr,
 * which returns the previous value.
 * Calling `agseterr(AGMAX)` turns off the writing of messages.
 *
 * The function @ref agerr is the main entry point for reporting an anomaly.
 * The first argument indicates the type of message.
 * Usually, the first argument is @ref AGWARN or @ref AGERR
 * to indicate warnings and errors, respectively.
 * Sometimes additional context information is only available in functions
 * calling the function where the error is actually caught.
 * In this case, the calling function can indicate that it is continuing
 * the current error by using @ref AGPREV as the first argument.
 * The remaining arguments to @ref agerr are the same as
 * the arguments to `printf`.
 *
 * The functions @ref agwarningf and @ref agerrorf are shorthand for
 * `agerr(AGWARN,...)` and `agerr(AGERR,...)`, respectively.
 *
 * Some applications desire to directly control the writing of messages.
 * Such an application can use the function @ref agseterrf to register
 * the function that the library should call to actually write the message.
 * The previous error function is returned.
 * By default, the message is written to `stderr`.
 *
 * Errors not written are stored in a log file.
 * The last recorded error can be retrieved by calling @ref aglasterr.
 * Unless the printing of error messages has been completely disabled
 * by a call to `agseterr(AGMAX)`, standard error must not be wide-oriented,
 * even if a user-provided error printing function is provided.
 *
 * The function @ref agerrors returns non-zero if errors have been reported.
