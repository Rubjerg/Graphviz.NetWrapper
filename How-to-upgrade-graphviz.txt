- Make sure that the toolset selected for GraphvizWrapper.dll is compatible with the vcruntime version shipped with graphviz.
- Remove all DLLs starting with `concrt`, `msvcp` or `vcruntime`. These are part of the Visual C++ redistributable package, and we're not shipping those.
- Remove all files ending in `.sh`, these are not crossplatform and we don't need them.
- Check if any other files are new, and investigate if that is expected.

- Compile and run the tests
