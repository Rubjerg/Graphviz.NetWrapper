- Navigate to https://gitlab.com/groups/graphviz/-/packages/ and click the version you want to upgrade to

First on Windows
- Download and extract `windows_10_cmake_Debug_Graphviz-<version>-win64.zip`.
- Navigate to `bin/` and copy all the files in that folder to `Graphviz.NetWrapper\GraphvizWrapper\graphvizfiles\Debug\`.
  Check that every existing file was overwritten.
- Navigate to `lib/` and copy all the .lib files in that folder to `Graphviz.NetWrapper\GraphvizWrapper\lib\`.
  Check that every existing file was overwritten.
- Navigate to `include/graphviz/` and copy all the .h files in that folder to `Graphviz.NetWrapper\GraphvizWrapper\include\`.
  Check that every existing file was overwritten.

- Download and extract `windows_10_cmake_Release_Graphviz-<version>-win64.zip`.
- Navigate to `bin/` and copy all the files in that folder to `Graphviz.NetWrapper\GraphvizWrapper\graphvizfiles\Release\`.
  Check that every existing file was overwritten.

- Make sure that the toolset selected for GraphvizWrapper.dll is compatible with the vcruntime version shipped with graphviz.
- Remove all new DLLs starting with `concrt`, `msvcp` or `vcruntime`. These are part of the Visual C++ redistributable package, and we're not shipping those.
- Remove all new files ending in `.sh`, these are not windows compatible and we don't need them.
- Check if any other files are new, and investigate if that is expected.

- Compile and run the tests

Now on linux (e.g. WSL)
- cd to GraphvizWrapper/graphvizfiles/
- Download the Fedora package (e.g. fedora_41_graphviz-<version>-cmake.rpm) into the current working directory 
- Run `bash unpack-rpm.sh fedora_41_graphviz-<version>-cmake.rpm` to deploy the files to the linux subfolder
- Run `bash patch-rpath.sh linux/` to patch the RPATH of all binaries so they can find the locally deployed version of graphviz.
- Make sure none of the include files have changed (as a sanity check that this is the same version as on windows)

- Compile and run the tests
- Update version number in README-src.md and run `bash generatereadme.sh`
